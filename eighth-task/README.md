## Styiling
This will be a continous WIP in order to improve the look and feel.
`TODO: Improve mobile version.`

## Add 404 and 'No movies found' pages with markup.
`localhost:3000/search/nomovie`

## When new user enters the site using direct link with search parameters â€“ show search results.
`localhost:3000/search/friday`

## When user clicks on a film item, redirect them to:  `localhost/film/id`
Go to `localhost:3000` and search, for instance, 'Friday' and click any movie. You can see that the movie data is displayed.

## Implement displaying 404 page for all invalid URLs
`localhost:3000/randomValueNotValid`

## By default, user lands on a new page with empty results page
`localhost:3000`

## When user performs a search on the page, change URL and show search results
Go to `localhost:3000` and search, for instance, 'Friday'.
