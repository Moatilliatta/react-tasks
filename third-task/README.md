## Getting Started

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Run the app: `npm run start`

The app will start running at `http://localhost:8080`

Run tests: `npm test`

Create build for production: `npm run build`

## Styling

This will be a continous WIP in order to improve the look and feel.

## Proptypes

In order to see proptypes work, open the developer tools's console and check the logs displayed. The properties `releaseDate` and `title` should be integer and string respectively. Take a look on `src\components\Results\Results.js:10`

## ErrorBoundary

Remove or comment the movie array (`src\components\Results\Results.js:10`). Refresh and ErrorBoundary Component will appear. In case it is not appearing you need to move to develop mode.

## Any comment please contact me via MS Teams.
